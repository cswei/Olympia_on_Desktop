// The functions in this file implement the Region abstraction used extensively
// throughout the X11 sample server. A Region is simply a set of disjoint
// (non-overlapping) rectangles, plus an "extent" rectangle which is the
// smallest single rectangle that contains all the non-overlapping rectangles.
//
// A Region is implemented as a "y-x-banded" array of rectangles.  This array
// imposes two degrees of order.  First, all rectangles are sorted by top side
// y coordinate first (y1), and then by left side x coordinate (x1).
//
// Furthermore, the rectangles are grouped into "bands".  Each rectangle in a
// band has the same top y coordinate (y1), and each has the same bottom y
// coordinate (y2).  Thus all rectangles in a band differ only in their left
// and right side (x1 and x2).  Bands are implicit in the array of rectangles:
// there is no separate list of band start pointers.
//
// The y-x band representation does not minimize rectangles.  In particular,
// if a rectangle vertically crosses a band (the rectangle has scan-lines in
// the y1 to y2 area spanned by the band), then the rectangle may be broken
// down into two or more smaller rectangles stacked one atop the other.
//
//  -----------                             -----------
//  |         |                             |         |             band 0
//  |         |  --------                   -----------  --------
//  |         |  |      |  in y-x banded    |         |  |      |   band 1
//  |         |  |      |  form is          |         |  |      |
//  -----------  |      |                   -----------  --------
//               |      |                                |      |   band 2
//               --------                                --------
//
// An added constraint on the rectangles is that they must cover as much
// horizontal area as possible: no two rectangles within a band are allowed
// to touch.
//
// Whenever possible, bands will be merged together to cover a greater vertical
// distance (and thus reduce the number of rectangles). Two bands can be merged
// only if the bottom of one touches the top of the other and they have
// rectangles in the same places (of the same width, of course).
