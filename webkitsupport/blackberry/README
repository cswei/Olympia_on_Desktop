This folder contains the olympia platform specific header files, and the implementation on Linux of the interfaces defined in these header files.

To make it compile , the header files were modified as below:

1.  OlympiaPlatformMisc.h   // function getlocaltime() added for JavaScriptCore/wtf/DateMath.cpp
2.  ScopePointer.h     // line 94,  delete[] m_object;  changed to delete[] this->m_object;
3.  streams/NetworkRequest.h    // include <limits.h>   for INT_MAX

Might need to revert above changes when RIM delivers the right version of above files.
