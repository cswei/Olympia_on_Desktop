This test checks that the first <script> tag after an unclosed <title> tag is parsed correctly. Early versions of the patch for Bugzilla Bug 3905 did not reset a state variable properly, causing the first <script></script> tag in the document to contain everything after the <title> tag.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
