<p>This tests for a bug where Remove Format would fail to remove links that were fully selected.  You should see plain text only in the editable region below.</p>
<div id="div" contenteditable="true"><a href="http://www.google.com/">This shouldn't be a link or underlined.</a></div>

<script>
var div = document.getElementById("div");
div.focus();
document.execCommand("SelectAll");
document.execCommand("RemoveFormat");
</script>
