<p>This tests for a bug where expansion for smart delete would not consider editable boundaries.  Only 'foo' should be deleted.  You should see ' bar'. <b>There is a bug: while the non-editable space isn't deleted, deletion inserts a placeholder when it shouldn't.</b></p>
<div contenteditable="true" id="div">foo
<span contenteditable="false"> bar</span></div>
