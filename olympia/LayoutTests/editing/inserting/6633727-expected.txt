This tests the fix for <rdar://problem/6633727> Hitting return at the end of a line with an anchor jumps me to the bottom of the message. If the test has passed, the numbers should be in order, and only "1" should be a link.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
