"<p> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br> "
"Version 2.1, February 1999</p> "
"<p> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</p> "
"<p> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p> "
"<p> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies "
"of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. </p> "
"<p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts "
"as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence "
"the version number 2.1.] </p> "
"<p> Preamble</p> "
"<p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your "
"freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change "
"free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p> "
"<p> This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the "
"Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You "
"can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better "
"strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p> "
"<p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that "
"you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge "
"for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of "
"it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do "
"these things.</p> "
"<p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these "
"rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for "
"you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. </p> "
"<p> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis "
"or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave "
"you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide "
"complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them "
"with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p> "
"<p> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the "
"library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p> "
"<p> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that "
"there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is "
"modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know "
"that what they have is not the original version, so that the original "
"author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.</p> "
"<p> Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of "
"any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot "
"effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that "
"any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be "
"consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. </p> "
"<p> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the "
"ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser "
"General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use "
"this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those "
"libraries into non-free programs. </p> "
"<p> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using "
"a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a "
"combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the "
"entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General "
"Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</p> "
"<p> We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it "
"does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less "
"of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages "
"are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain "
"special circumstances.</p> "
"<p> For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to "
"encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be "
"allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free "
"library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free "
"software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p> "
"<p> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of "
"free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in "
"non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating "
"system.</p> "
"<p> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the "
"users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run "
"that program using a modified version of the Library.</p> "
"<p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "
"\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The "
"former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</p> "
"<p> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br> "
"TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION </p> "
"<ol start=\"0\"> "
"<li>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other "
"program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or "
"other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). "
"Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". "
"<p> A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs "
"(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p> "
"<p> The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the "
"Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under "
"copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated "
"straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is "
"included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) </p> "
"<p> \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for "
"making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means "
"all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</p> "
"<p>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation "
"and installation of the library.</p> "
"<p> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of "
"running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from "
"such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for "
"writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does "
"and what the program that uses the Library does.</p> "
"</li> "
"<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's "
"complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that "
"you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an "
"appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact "
"all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any "
"warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. "
"<p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, "
"and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a "
"fee.</p> "
"</li> "
"<li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion "
"of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and "
"distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: "
"<ul style=\"list-style:lower-alpha\"> "
"<li>The modified work must itself be a software library.</li> "
"<li>You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li> "
"<li>You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no "
"charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li> "
"<li> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a "
"table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses "
"the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, "
"in the event an application does not supply such function or "
"table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. "
"<p> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has "
"a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any "
"application-supplied function or table used by this function must "
"be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)</p> "
"</li> "
"</ul> "
"<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If "
"identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in "
"themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those "
"sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based "
"on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of "
"this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote "
"it.</p> "
"<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest "
"your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or "
"collective works based on the Library.</p> "
"<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library "
"with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of "
"a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under "
"the scope of this License. </p> "
"</li> "
"<li> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public "
"License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do "
"this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, "
"instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the "
"ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in "
"these notices. "
"<p> Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for "
"that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p> "
"<p> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of "
"the Library into a program that is not a library. </p> "
"</li> "
"<li>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or "
"derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form "
"under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which "
"must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a "
"medium customarily used for software interchange. "
"<p> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy "
"from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the "
"source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not "
"compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p> "
"</li> "
"<li>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or "
"linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a "
"work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and "
"therefore falls outside the scope of this License. "
"<p> However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library "
"creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it "
"contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the "
"library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. "
"Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. </p> "
"<p> When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file "
"that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</p> "
"<p>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be "
"linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The "
"threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. </p> "
"<p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data "
"structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline "
"functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative "
"work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the "
"Library will still fall under Section 6.) </p> "
"<p> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may "
"distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. "
"Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. </p> "
"</li> "
"<li>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or "
"link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work "
"under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit "
"modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. "
"<p> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the "
"Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work "
"during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the "
"copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one "
"of these things:</p> "
"<ul style=\"list-style:lower-alpha\"> "
"<li>Accompany the work with the complete corresponding "
"machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under "
"Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked "
"with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the "
"user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified "
"executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood "
"that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the "
"Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application "
"to use the modified definitions.)</li> "
"<li>Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the "
"Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a "
"copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) "
"will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if "
"the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</li> "
"<li>Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at "
"least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more "
"than the cost of performing this distribution.</li> "
"<li> If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above "
"specified materials from the same place.</li> "
"<li> Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. </li> "
"</ul> "
"<p> For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the "
"Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for "
"reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, "
"the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is "
"normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on "
"which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies "
"the executable.</p> "
"<p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license "
"restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally "
"accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot "
"use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.</p> "
"</li> "
"<li>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the "
"Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library "
"facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on "
"the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise "
"permitted, and provided that you do these two things: "
"<ul style=\"list-style:lower-alpha\"> "
"<li>Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work "
"based on the Library, uncombined with any other library "
"facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. </li> "
"<li>Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact "
"that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining "
"where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li> "
"</ul> "
"</li> "
"<li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute "
"the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any "
"attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your "
"rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, "
"or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</li> "
"<li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not "
"signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are "
"prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by "
"modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and "
"all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying "
"the Library or works based on it.</li> "
"<li>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the "
"Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the "
"original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further "
"restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. "
"You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. </li> "
"<li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent "
"infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), "
"conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not "
"excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot "
"distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you "
"may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent "
"license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then "
"the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to "
"refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. "
"<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any "
"particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, "
"and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. </p> "
"<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any "
"patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any "
"such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is "
"implemented by public license practices. Many people have made "
"generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that "
"system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing "
"to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p> "
"<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to "
"be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p> "
"</li> "
"<li>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in "
"certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the "
"original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add "
"an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, "
"so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus "
"excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if "
"written in the body of this License.</li> "
"<li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new "
"versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. "
"Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. "
"Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library "
"specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "
"\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and "
"conditions either of that version or of any later version published by "
"the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by "
"the Free Software Foundation.</li> "
"<li> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, "
"write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is "
"copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free "
"Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our "
"decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status "
"of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. "
"<p> NO WARRANTY</p> "
"</li> "
"<li>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO "
"WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. "
"EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR "
"OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br> "
"IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR "
"PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME "
"THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. </li> "
"<li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN "
"WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY "
"AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU "
"FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE "
"LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING "
"RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF "
"SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH "
"DAMAGES.</li> "
"</ol> "
"<p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p> "
"<p> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p> "
